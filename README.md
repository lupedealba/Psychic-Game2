# Psychic-Game

**How the Game Works:**
For this project the player is competing with the computer by guessing a letter. They guess a letter by typing a letter. If the letter
is incorrect, the player gets to try again. There is a total of 9 guesses per game so if the player doesn't guess the letter the losses 
score goes up by one. If the player guesses correctly the win score goes up by one. After the player wins or looses the game resets to play
again.

**How is it Useful:** My project is useful becuase it allows the users to stimulate their brain through different scenarios that involve chanece.
